# ThreatHunting-Splunk üõ°Ô∏è

## Overview

Welcome to **ThreatHunting-Splunk**, a public repository dedicated to providing Splunk-based threat hunting resources and guides. This project, maintained by **MinoTauro2020**, focuses on creating detailed Markdown files with Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) queries to help security analysts detect and investigate various cyber threats, such as brute force attacks, Kerberoasting, credential dumping, persistence, and more.

**üÜï Latest Updates**: Added 6 new advanced threat hunting investigations focusing on sophisticated attack techniques like Golden Ticket detection, LOLBins abuse, Shadow Credentials, NTLM Relay, Process Hollowing, and Registry Persistence. These investigations feature:
- **Precise, non-generic SPL queries** tailored for specific attack patterns
- **Advanced correlation techniques** across multiple data sources
- **Detailed detection rationale** with clear indicators of compromise
- **Comprehensive coverage** from basic detection to advanced hunting
- **Real-world applicability** based on current threat landscape

Whether you're hunting for malicious activity in Active Directory, analyzing PowerShell usage, or investigating lateral movement, this repository offers structured guides to enhance your threat hunting capabilities using Splunk.
