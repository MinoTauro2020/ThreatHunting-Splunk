# ThreatHunting-Splunk üõ°Ô∏è

## Overview

Welcome to **ThreatHunting-Splunk**, a public repository dedicated to providing Splunk-based threat hunting resources and guides. This project, maintained by **MinoTauro2020**, focuses on creating detailed Markdown files with Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) queries to help security analysts detect and investigate various cyber threats, such as brute force attacks, Kerberoasting, credential dumping, persistence, and more.

Whether you're hunting for malicious activity in Active Directory, analyzing PowerShell usage, or investigating lateral movement, this repository offers structured guides to enhance your threat hunting capabilities using Splunk.
